# NBA Analysis
This github repo represents my interest project surrounding the NBA. In this repo, there will be subprojects (denoted by the main folders). 

## NBA Wins vs PD Analysis
This is a small interest project of mine revolving around a NBA team's wins versus how much they would be projected to earn based on their point differential. 

Some teams in the NBA out perform their talent level and some under perform. The binary outcome of a NBA game, win or loss, is what makes the games meaningful and important. However, the binnary outcome, can also make some teams look better or worse (i.e. if a decent team is good in crunch time and wins more close games than random chance). Point differential is an important statistic in the NBA, typically cited as one of the main predictors of a team's success in the playoffs. I'm doing this project just out of the simple interest of the teams who have drastically out or under performed over the history of basketball. 

## Symbiotic NBA players
Which players are great regardless of how their teammates perform and which players' games falter or thrive based on a different player. The idea for this analysis was inspired by a comment made on an NBA podcast I was listening to which went something like "You know if Harden is having a bad game then Capela is probably ineffective as well". Most players will probably be uninteresting as you would expect some weak positive trend between players (i.e. usually whole teams can be playing hot for a night or completely off). I'm thinking this study could possibly provide interesting insight into which players are good indepednent of others and which players are good system players and shine because they are surrounded by a great player (i.e. LeBron James and the shooters that surround him)
