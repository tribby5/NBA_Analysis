# NBA Wins vs PD Analysis
This is a small interest project of mine revolving around a NBA team's wins versus how much they would be projected to earn based on their point differential. 

#### Idea
Some teams in the NBA out perform their talent level and some under perform. The binary outcome of a NBA game, win or loss, is what makes the games meaningful and important. However, the binnary outcome, can also make some teams look better or worse (i.e. if a decent team is good in crunch time and wins more close games than random chance). Point differential is an important statistic in the NBA, typically cited as one of the main predictors of a team's success in the playoffs. I'm doing this project just out of the simple interest of the teams who have drastically out or under performed over the history of basketball.
